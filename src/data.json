  "copy": "Happy anniversary babyyyy, can't believe it's been a month already! It feels like it’s been so much longer, in the best way possible. You're my best friend and I'm so grateful for you. I love you so much and I can't wait to see you soon!! You're my everything and I'm so lucky to have you! It's crazy how close we've become in a month.\n\nYou are someone I trust completely someone I can confide in and someone who makes me feel so loved and cared for.💖 You know so much about me baby, you know my ins and outs, what makes me smile and happy and what makes me sad. You know my fears and my dreams, you know my past and my present. You know my favourite foods and my favourite movies. You know my favourite colour 🧡 and my favourite song and you are my favourite person 🥰.\n\nWe've been through some tough times in this month but alhamdulillah we found a way out, and we both realised that we are stronger together 💪🏾 I used to be such a pessimistic person, I had no hope and would always expect things to go wrong, I would always overthink and doubt myself but ever since you came along I've felt none of that. I have hope now I have optimism I haven't overthought in a long time and all because of you and the peace you bring me.\n\nYou know I say this to you all the time but you give me the love 💖 I've been longing for and I truly appreciate that! You accepted me for who I am, my biggest fear was I would never be enough for anyone or be the person someone wants to be with. I always had the thought that my epilepsy would be too much for someone to take on, the fact I don’t drive would put someone off and my height all these insecurities you just saw past and saw me for who I am and wallah you made me feel so special and you always make me feel so special baby.\n\nWhen I met you and spoke to you I knew that you were the one just by the connection we had and how similar we were. I told Iqbal and he was like get to know her and now that I have, both Jamal and Iqbal see how much you mean to me they have both said that there's kushi 😊 in my voice when I speak about you because you have given me a feeling of euphoria.\n\nI don’t know what I did to deserve such a beautiful stunning gorgeous girl 😍wallah you’re the most incredible girl ever and I'm not just saying that. I saw TikTok that said when you meet your girl, the one for you, she is the most attractive person to you and makes everyone else unattractive and that is so true because wallah you’re so leng babe like oh my god the way you make me feel when you snap😍🥵 and when I see you it’s mental 😍😍! I remember our first date and I saw you across the road I was like wow she's so stunning like you actually are and in your scrubs oh my god idk what it is but you in scrubs is so fit like damnnn that's my girl 😍\n\nWe’ve had 3 amazing dates and one incredible unplanned date and each one has been magical the feeling I get when I hold you and I'm close to is something I’ve never felt, every time I hold you in my arms its like I have the whole world 🌍 right there and all the troubles of the world disappear. Seeing you laugh and smile brings joy to my heart💞 and just your physical touch makes my heart warm 💓 wow I miss you so much \n\nBaby I know we’ve had some tough times and you are currently going through a tough time which is why you are receiving your anniversary gift early but we got this my love, I’ve got you and you’ve got me, you’re my Aysh my baby and I will do anything for you I will always be here to listen, to support, to help fix and to make you smile 😊. Remember what I said no refunds no returns I want you baby I want you in all you are the ups the downs the bad times the good times because I love you and I'm here for you I'm committed and I want this month to be the first of many in a lifetime inshallah.\n\nSo my little crackhead happy early one month anniversary I hope this makes you smile because you deserve to smile and you deserve the world and inshallah I will give you that one day! Youre such an inspiration baby you have achieved so much and done it all by yourself, you should be so proud my love! You're a beautiful, smart, caring loving, and amazing girl and i always pray allah grants you happiness, peace and jannah because you deserve it baby! Always remember I got you baby, it’s you and me against the world and we got this! I love you more than anything baby you are my world my life my love my happiness my everything and I love you so so much baby girl 🥰🥰❤️❤️😘\n\n Kisses, hugs and lots of unconditional love from your best friend, man, hubby, fellow crackhead and for the whites your boyfriend (Astags)xoxoxoxoxoxoxo🥰😘❤️\n\n ."
